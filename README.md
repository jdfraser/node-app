# Node Chat
## Description
This is a demo app which provides a simple chat server in node, and a client in React.

## Local Development
To run locally, clone the repo, then from within your local repo's root directory, run:
```
cd server
npm start
```
After starting up, the app will be available at http://localhost:4000.

## Testing
The `client` and `server` directories each have their own set of tests. To run either, `cd` to that directory, then use:
```
npm test
```
