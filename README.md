# Node Chat
## Description
This is a demo app which provides a simple chat server in node, and a client in React.

## Installation
To use this app, clone the repo, then from within your local repo's root directory, run the following command:
```
npm run build && npm start
```
After building and starting up, the app will be available at http://localhost:4000.

## Other configurations
The server and client can be run independently for easier debugging.

To run the server as a standalone process:
```
cd server && npm start
```
To run the client as a standalone process (client will run on port 3000 to avoid collision with server):
```
cd client && npm start
```
